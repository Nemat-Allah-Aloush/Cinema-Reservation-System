# Cinema-Reservation-System
An academic project at HIAST aimed to build a cinema reservation system. The project is written in C# programing language and Oracle Database. 

## About the project
The project aims to develope a software reservation system that manages and stores all operations related to the cinema house, including hall information, movies,
show times, and others. Which helps later to obtain useful statistics for the development of work.

Description:
- The cinema has several theaters.
- Each hall contains a number of seats, and the seats are in rows, and each row has a specific number.
- Seats are numbered with the row number and seat position in a row.
- A single movie can have multiple shows at different times, and it can be shown in multiple theaters.
- We are interested in recording the data of the information personnel and following up their registrations on the reservation system.
- We are interested in storing data about the films shown (the film's genre, its name, the name of its director and most prominent actors, its description, its running time in minutes)
